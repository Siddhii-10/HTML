            <h1> <b><u><center>Calculus Definition</center></u></b></h1>
            <p> <b>Calculus,</b>a branch of Mathematics, developed by <i><b>Newton and Leibniz</b></i>,
            deals with the study of the rate of change. Calculus define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup>
            CM is generally used in Mathematices models to obtain optimal solutions.<i>It helps us 
            to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function.</i>
            Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation,
            integration,limits,functions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculation provide formulas
            like:H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
